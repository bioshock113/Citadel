### This is a running log of my adventures in technology and the challenges I've faced.  I've been working on getting a home server up and running. Lets talk a little bit about that.
***HP Z420***  
That's the computer I chose to get this adventure off the ground. 
Shortly after learning about such a machine from my coworkers, I grabbed it off Ebay. It's a pretty decent machine, albeit older.  
### Specs
 - E5-1650 V2
 - 64gb ECC DDR3 1333MHz
 - 1x8TB HDD + 1x3TB HDD & 128gb SSD as boot drive.  
### Configuring the machine  
The first big choice I had to make was what operating system to run.  
Originally I was thinking *Ubuntu* as I have some experience with it, but due to the machines I interact with at work, I chose *Windows Server 2012*. Funnily enough about a day of tinkering with *Windows Server 2012* I **did** switch over to *Ubuntu* as I was having some issues configuring user permissions.  
**BUT** about a day after using *Ubuntu*, I encountered more problems and, rather than resolve them, opted to switch **YET AGAIN** and went to *Windows 10 Pro*.  
I don't really know why I chose a non-server OS to host a server on but I had most of my desired applications setup properly.  
We'll get into that later.  
**BUT** (yepp, there's another but) I plan on going back to Windows Server 2012 as it can do things that I'll need down the road.  
So, now that that whole saga has been explained lets move on.
### Desired Applications
*"What do I even want a home server for?"* is what I asked myself when the topic came up at work. So far this is what I've come up with.  
#### File Sharing 
- I wanted a place to store all of my photos, documents, videos, music, and random other things.
The big draw for me here is to access all of my stuff without needing the internet. It's faster and I own the data.
#### TV/Movie Streaming
- With movies and tv shows becoming increasingly hard to find all in one place, having it all in one spot for personal access is a super nice feature.
Sometimes you can't even **find** a piece of media online due to the owner's deciding to not make it available in my country. (Yes, I know, "Use a VPN!")
That's not the entire point though.
- Plex enables me to send content straight to any TV and/or phone in my home. This means my family can watch their shows at any time, ad-free, buffer-free.
#### Game Servers
- Something I'm really looking forward to is playing video games with my son once he's older. I got the jump on it and started hosting a Minecraft server for
friends to join. One day my son will join me in one of my favorite games of all time. I'm super excited to make that happen.
- I'd also like to setup a Project Zomboid server too. Really whatever game I can host, I **want** to host.
#### Home Automation
- Currently I don't have any smart devices to control but I know eventually I will. It'd be nice to have a dashboard of easily modifiable controls for various home appliances.
#### The Learning Opportunites
- I enjoy acquiring new skills and learn most effectively when I can actually apply those skills. Since I work in an environment dealing with server related tasks and I plan on continuing along this path, it only makes sense to practice those skills at home as a hobby.
