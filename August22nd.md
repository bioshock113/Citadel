#### Website Development
I finally figured out why my code was making the last paragraph into a header.  
I'm pretty sure it had something to do with uncontained CSS code that didn't have enclosing brackets. Actually I think it was having text touching a horizontal line-break dash which I just figured out while writing this can cause emboldened text. *sigh*

#### Docker
My adventures in Docker has finally actually **started!**  
My whole issue was the inability to get *Heimdall* running properly.  
Turns out it was incorrectly defining the ports it needed to run on so it just...wouldn't run.  
Now that I have sorted out I plan on reinstalling *Windows Server* and getting everything spun back up.
Now I know ruining all of this work I've put into troubleshooting everything has a very high chance of introducing even **more** problems but hey, I learn by causing my own issues and having to fix them.

So wish me luck. I'll hopefully succeed without too many issues. *crosses fingers*
