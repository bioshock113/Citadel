#### Home Server Successes

So I may have lied in my last post in late August. It wasn't the last the that I would change something.

Since then I have set up the Z420 on Windows Server 2019, installed Sonarr, Radarr, Jackett, Plex, qBitTorrent, and the Minecraft Server.
It has been running flawlessly since.

All of those programs are running within the main OS as executables instead of containers which saddens me as I was hoping to conquer Docker, but hey its all working without issues so I wont complain.

I've been able to stream through Plex and enjoy my efforts better than I was originally hoping!

And I've been playing a lot of Minecraft with friends on the server with no complaints!

#### New Acquisitions

I've come into the possession of a Dell R420 server recently. I purchased new fans for it but I still need to replace the old HDD's within it.

It has 48gb of RAM (I think) and a secondary slot for a CPU. Perhaps in the future I'll add a second but first I must come up with a main need for the server as a whole.

Regardless, I'm excited for what I could learn from such a machine and I hope to glean new knowledge from it.

#### Side Projects

I repurposed an older desktop acquired for my sister to play video games on. She's been joining me in the Minecraft server without issue which makes me very happy.

The plan for the future is to swap cases and add in a new PSU & GTX 1070 I have shelved so she can play even more games. I hope I can show her how to complete that build so she can possibly replace parts herself if necessary.

That's all that I have for now. Thanks for reading!
